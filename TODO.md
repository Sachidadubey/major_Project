# TODO: Fix Deployment Error

## Issue

- Deployment on Render fails with "Cannot find module './operations/add_user'" from mongodb package.

## Root Cause

- Incompatible mongodb driver version: package.json had mongodb ^5.7.0, but mongoose ^8.17.0 requires mongodb ^6.0.0.
- Node version v22.17.0 may not be fully supported by mongodb driver.

## Changes Made

- [x] Updated package.json: mongodb to ^6.0.0
- [x] Updated package.json: node engine to 20
- [x] Fixed syntax error in app.js (removed invalid dbName line)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Run `npm install` to update dependencies
- [ ] Test locally with `node app.js` or `npm run dev`
- [ ] Commit changes and push to repository
- [ ] Redeploy on Render
- [ ] Verify deployment succeeds
